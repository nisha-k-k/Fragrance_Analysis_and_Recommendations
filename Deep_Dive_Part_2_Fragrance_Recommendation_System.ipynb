    "# Deep Dive into Fragrances, Part 2: Fragrance Recommendations \n",
    "### Why this Project? \n",
    "This project is in two parts: An analysis of fragrance notes in various fragrances and user-preferred fragrance notes, and a recommendation system that gives 5 fragrance recommendations based on preferred fragrance notes. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project holds significant importance in the realm of data science and consumer preferences. By meticulously analyzing fragrance notes and comparing them to individual preferences, it provides valuable insights into the intricate world of scent preferences. This not only enhances our understanding of consumer behavior but also empowers businesses in the fragrance industry to tailor their offerings to specific demographics. Furthermore, the recommendation system introduces a personalized element, revolutionizing how consumers discover and select fragrances. This innovation has the potential to revolutionize the fragrance market, creating a more tailored and satisfying experience for consumers while offering businesses the opportunity to refine their product offerings. Overall, this project not only showcases the power of data-driven insights but also addresses a tangible need in a thriving industry.\n",

The perfume opens with notes of Japanese herbs and citruses, moves to a slightly floral spicy middle and settles into a deep woody base accentuated by the use of the Hinoki cedar that dot the mountain landscapes. A deeply personal and spiritual scent, Kagiroi is a scent of shifting aromatic complexities representing transitions in the journey of life.Parfum Edition: We are honored and delighted to offer the rare and precious Parfum edition of Kagiroi, which adds to the composition a precious specimen of Japanese agarwood, which adds rich, spiritual dimensionality and a truly impressive and long-lasting drydown to this already complex and wonderful scent.   \n",

Thereafter, incense unveils amber and white musk to create a bewitching and wild dance. What We Think A sweet and fruity fragrance with a rich long lasting warmth. Like a decadent dessert, it starts off bringing together the bright freshness of the tangerine with some sweet berry and apple notes and the creaminess of the toffee and vanilla. The fragrance smoothly transitions into a deliciously bold blend of amber, leather, sweet vanilla and creamy woods. Absolutely mouthwatering.   \n",

The result is A Blvd. Called Sunset, a bright, fresh, just the right amount of edgy journey across our wild and beautiful city. Bright, fresh bergamot sparkles in a smooth, salty, almond-inflected breeze, while a masculine leaning-floral blend of violet and jasmine combines with a leather that evokes the biker bars and metal clubs so famously captured in Ed Ruscha's seminal photo book. A smooth, intoxicating base of sandalwood, vanilla, and tonka goes down like a perfect mixed drink, comforting and sensual all at once. If you ever get a chance to take a trip down Sunset, there's nothing like it in the world. But the next best thing is a day spent wearing A Blvd. Called Sunset- a perfect tribute to the heart and soul of Los Angeles.   \n",

In addition to this, I plan on adding into a new database of fragrances, so there will be more fragrances that could be recommended. "
